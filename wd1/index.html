                    <p>
                        In 1957 post <i>World War II</i> England, the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis">Suez Crisis</a></i> meant <b>petrol</b> was <b>rationed</b>. People felt that the oversized gas guzzling cars didn't make sense anymore.
                        Smaller cars such as the German <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcar#Bubble_cars">bubble cars</a></i> and the Italian <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_500">Fiat 500</a></i> were beginning to be produced and sold successfully around Europe. <i>Leonard Lord</i>, head of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation">British Motor Corporation (BMC)</a></i> thought he could do one <em>better</em> than his German and Italian counterparts and set out on a mission to design <b>a proper miniature car</b>.

                    <h3>Alec's Angels</h3>
                    <p>The task of fulfilling Lord's vision fell to BMC engineer <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Issigonis">Alec Issigonis</a></i>. His remit; to build a <b>fuel efficient</b> car capable of transporting <b>four adults</b> which everyone could <b>afford</b>.
                        In completing their task Issigonis and his team departed from <b>traditional automobile design</b> and a lot of their pioneering developments are still with us to this day.
                        They mounted the engine <i>transversely</i> across the <em>front</em> axle and put the wheels right at the edge of the four corners of the car to <em>maximize</em> space in the cockpit.

                    <h3>Small and Mighty! But Why?</h3>
                    <p>It turns out that Issigonis' design innovations, driven by <b>necessity</b> due to a <b>fuel crisis</b> had an unintended impact on its ability to match much  <b>more powerful cars</b> in the motorsport world.
                        Mounting the engine sideways at the front of the car improved <b>grip</b> and pushing the wheels to the four corners meant it handled like a <b>go-kart</b>, a fact that would be exploited to its fullest potential later on by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_(car_maker)">John Cooper</a></i>.

                        <i>John Cooper</i>, a giant of <b>British motorsport</b> got his hands on the Mini in <b>1961</b>, he fitted a <b>larger engine</b>, <b>bigger brakes</b> and with a few tweaks here and there the <i>Mini Cooper</i> was born. 
                        The Mini was transformed from a <b>fuel efficient economy car</b> to a <b>rallying legend</b> that would go on to win the prestigious <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Rally">Monte Carlo Rally</a></i> <b>three times</b> in 1964, '65 and '67.

                        The Mini was a car of the people and for the people.

                    The sports model of the BMW Minis still bears the <i>Cooper</i> name and competes in <b>motorsport</b> world wide just like their ancestors. Although BMW's re-imagined version of the Mini has been incredibly successful, many fans of the Classic Mini like myself, feel it lacks the <b>soul</b> of the original.
