                    <p>
                        My own Mini is a <b>1988 Mini City E</b> which I bought when I was 16. I drove this car to my <i>Leaving Cert</i> and it brought me to my <i>Debs</i> and to and from <b>college</b> for about two months until the engine decided to <b>blow up</b>.
                        The car was previously owned by a Nun who still had the <b>original bill of sale</b> and <b>original users manual</b> in the dashboard along with tons of religious paraphernalia.

                    <h3>Seen Better Days</h3>
                    <p>
                        Having begrudgingly <b>sold</b> the car to my <b>Dad</b> so I could afford to buy something <b>more reliable</b>, the car sat outside in the rain for a few years feeling sorry for itself and began <b>rotting</b> quite badly. It even had a dent on the rear as a result of my Dad pushing it around the yard with a tractor.
                        When someone else came to buy the car, I decided I couldn't let it go so I <b>bought it back</b> off of my Dad. He charged me €50 more than he was charging the man who had come to buy the car.

                        The car was so <b>rotten</b> underneath that it would need to be either fully <b>restored</b> or <b>scrapped</b>. The previous owner had tried to carry out some <b>botched repairs</b> on the underside with filler and even newspaper. The car was totally stripped back to <b>bare metal</b> to see the full extent of the rot and there was not much metal left.

                    <p>
                        In 2020 during <b>lock-down</b> I bought a <b>mig welder</b> and set about trying to learn how to weld from the <b>University of YouTube</b>. Eventually after plenty of terrible welding, I managed to put together a <i>rotisserie jig</i> so that the shell could be <b>rotated</b> to repair the floor panels underneath the car.
                        The photo above is the current status of this project and as you can see there is a <b>lot</b> more to do.

                <h3>Counting The Cost</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately the parts needed to carry out a restoration such as this one <b>aren't exactly cheap</b>. It is very <em>hard</em> to get them in <i>Ireland</i> so I had to order the new panels needed from suppliers in the <i>UK</i>. Below is a table containing the <b>panels</b> I have bought to <b>restore</b> the body of the Mini and how much they cost.
