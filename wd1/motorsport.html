                <h3>The Name's Cooper, John Cooper</h3>
                <p> 
                    <i>John Cooper</i> was originally a <b>toolmaker</b> who served as an <b>instrument maker</b> in the <i>Royal Air Force</i> during <i>World War II</i>. He and his father, Charles owned a small garage in Surrey, England which specialized in <b>maintaining race cars</b>. 
                    In 1948 the pair set up the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Car_Company">Cooper Car Company</a></i>. They <b>revolutionised</b> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">Formula One</a></i> by putting the engine <em>behind</em> the driver. This innovation helped them to win numerous <i>Grand Prix</i>.

                <p>
                    John Cooper and Alec Issigonis were friends through competing against each other on the <b>race track</b> and also in a professional sphere because the <b>Cooper Car Company bought engines from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation">BMC</a></b>.
                    Cooper saw the <b>racing potential</b> of the Mini even before it had launched. Cooper eventually persuaded Issigonis to produce a GT version of the Mini having produced his own <b>prototype</b> and raced it at <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit">Monza</a></i>, and so the <i>Mini Cooper</i> was born!

                    The original Mini Cooper was such a success that an <b>upgraded version</b> was then produced. This version was called the <i>Cooper S</i> and boasted <em>70 bhp</em>, a marked improvement on the original which had <em>55 bhp</em>.  This model was produced in two engine capacities 1275 cc and 970 cc specifically to race in the under 1000 cc and 1300 cc.

                    Three years after production, the Mini won its first Rally, the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Rally">Tulip Rally</a></i> in the <i>Netherlands</i>.
                    This success would pave the way for an illustrious <b>motorsports legacy</b> which included wins at the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Rally">Monte Carlo Rally</a></i> three times in 1964, '65 and '67 and numerous successes in <b>touring car championships</b> and <b>endurance races</b>.
